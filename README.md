# Hi there, I'm Cristhian Lucinger 👋

**Cybersecurity Researcher | Purple Team Strategist | Applied Cryptography**

I bridge the gap between **Theoretical Mathematics** and **Offensive Security**. My current research focuses on algorithmic rigidity in cryptographic systems and optimizing Red Team reconnaissance via high-performance computing (HPC).

## 🚀 Featured Research: Model P3 (ACS)

I am the creator of **Model P3 (Algorithmic Compression Signatures)**, a novel methodology for passive RSA auditing that enables stealth reconnaissance without triggering IDS/IPS signatures.

### The Breakthrough
- **Discovery:** Proved Universal Scaling Law: `R = 1 + O/S` enabling deterministic classification of RSA keys (2048/4096-bit) without metadata parsing
- **Accuracy:** Detects low-entropy honeypots with **100% precision**
- **Application:** Red Team reconnaissance optimization via passive cryptographic analysis
- **Impact:** Mitigates resource exhaustion during security operations
